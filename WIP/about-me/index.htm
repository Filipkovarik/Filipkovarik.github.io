				Hello, I'm <tooltip>Sophiα<ttcontent>
					A name chosen for its meaning, derived from Ancient&nbsp;Greek σοφῐ́ᾱ, "knowledge of a higher kind: learning, wisdom" (Wiktionary.org);
					I sometimes use an alpha instead of an "a".
					</ttcontent></tooltip>!
				
				
				<br>					
				<b>I am interested in:</b>
				<tooltip>Linguistics<ttcontent>
						Linguistics is about how languages work and are used, not just knowing as many languages as possible, but besides that,
						I'm a Czech native, fluent in English, learning French in school, and casually Esperanto.
						I'm interested in various languages, including Japanese (and its kanji).
						I like constructing languages and writing systems.
					</ttcontent></tooltip>
				, <tooltip>Computer Science<ttcontent>
						This was my main interest up until I got into linguistics. Binary adders, cellular automata, the halting problem; certainly not everything, but also a lot. As for programming languagees: I use HTML, CSS and JS and I know a bunch of Lua and recently Python, also some C# and Java basics.
					</ttcontent></tooltip>
				, <tooltip>Maths<ttcontent>
						I've been shown the beauty of mathematics. What that means exactly for me is hard to grasp, but it isn't about being able to add big numbers quickly.
					</ttcontent></tooltip>
				, <tooltip>Philosophy<ttcontent>
						A lot of subjects I'm interested in fall in this category. I'm not a philosopher, but I'd also say my understading goes deeper than an average person's.
					</ttcontent></tooltip>
				, <tooltip>Music<ttcontent>
						I've been playing the keyboard (keyboard piano) for a long time now, but I feel like the results don't match up. I listen mainly to music which holds some meaning for me, including video game soundtracks, but most genres are fine by me.
					</ttcontent></tooltip>
				, <tooltip>Science<ttcontent>
						no description yet
					</ttcontent></tooltip>
				, <tooltip>Ace&nbsp;Attorney,&nbsp;Danganronpa<ttcontent>
						The Ace Attorney and Danganronpa game franchises and Ghost Trick. I'm in the middle of watching a translated gameplay of NDRV3 and DGS2, and I've watched gameplays of all preceding titles as far as I know. My unfinished projects include a timeline of the events of the whole Ace Attorney franchise.
					</ttcontent></tooltip>
				<br>
				<b>I am:</b>
				<tooltip>centre&#8209;left<ttcontent>
						On most issues, I have a left&#8209;leaning centrist approach.
					</ttcontent></tooltip>
				, <tooltip>agnostic atheist<ttcontent>
						I'm practically an atheist, as is the majority of Czech people. I don't believe any theistic religion is correct, but I'm not saying that none are.
					</ttcontent></tooltip>
				, <tooltip>autistic<ttcontent>
						I'm never perfect at social interactions.
						I can be overloaded by too many things happening around me, I don't like sudden noises, etc., because I'm often focused else than on my surroundings.
						Routines are important for me, nothing spontaneous.
						There are certain exceptions, but that's the general idea.
						(I have been formally diagnosed with Asperger's.)
					</ttcontent></tooltip>
				, <tooltip>agender<ttcontent>
						Gender? No thanks. I don't mind any pronouns (I use "they"), so I'm fine with you using "she" or "he", but I'm not a boy or a girl, just a person; (I could be more precise and say I'm agenderflux)
					</ttcontent></tooltip>
				, <tooltip>grey&#8209;asexual<ttcontent>
						Sexuality? No thanks. I'm practically asexual. (That means not experiencing sexual attraction).
					</ttcontent></tooltip>
				, <tooltip>aromantic<ttcontent>
						Romance? Nah. I'm not into dating and such, in fact, the idea of partners' love repulses me. I can still bond in close friendships, though.
					</ttcontent></tooltip>
